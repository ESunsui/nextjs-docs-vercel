# Quick Start

The next steps will help you quickly get started with MakiFBT

## Print ArUco pattern

ArUco is an open source small AR virtual reality augmentation library. An ArUco mark has a set of black borders on the periphery, and a two-dimensional matrix that determines the mark ID inside. The black border can speed up the detection speed of the mark in the image, and the internal two-dimensional code can uniquely identify the mark, and perform error detection and error correction at the same time.

In MakiFBT we use the ArUco pattern as follows

Print the pattern on a white A4 paper (use a full-page photo, and cancel the fit frame printing. The pattern should occupy as much space as possible on the paper without deformation), and our ArUco pattern is finished.

## Android Settings

**Currently** we only support Android devices.

### MakiAdnroid Setup

We use two Android mobile phones to capture motion from two perspectives, thus achieving higher capture accuracy and better results than the same type of single-camera solutions.

Apk can be download [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive).

In order to run MakiAndroid, your phone needs to have Android9 or above, and at least one rear camera. The computing performance of the mobile phone will directly affect the accuracy and fluency of motion capture. If you have multiple devices, it is recommended to use better ones.

The Android phone needs to be connected to the same LAN as the computer.

### Equipment Placement

Remember the ArUco pattern we printed at the beginning? Now we need to use it! Place the ArUco on a flat, light-colored ground, and keep the surrounding area open. For players with VR experience: place the pattern in the center of your safe zone.

The placement of equipment should follow the following principles.

The mobile phone must be used with a vertical screen, and the rear camera is used for shooting. (In case you don't know what rear is: the direction from the phone screen to your eyes is defined as the front, and the opposite side is called the rear.)

In terms of location selection, if you use the typical configuration of two mobile phones, there are some locations to choose from:

- 45 degrees left front and 45 degrees right front.
- Straight ahead and straight left (right).
- The angle you make with the two devices should be between 80 and 120 degrees.

After determining the orientation, the distance from the mobile phone to the center of the play area should be about 3-4 meters. Make sure they are as far away as possible if you can't reach the suggested distance.

Use brackets or other methods to reliably fix the mobile phone to prevent them from shaking and shifting. The height of the mobile phone should be between 1.4-1.8 meters, with a slight overlooking angle, and the ArUco pattern can be clearly captured (turn on the camera to confirm).

keep in mind! The range the camera can capture is reliable motion capture range. The final motion capture area is the intersection rather than the union of multiple devices.

### Run on mobile

After placing the phone, open MakiAndroid, click the "Take Image" button, and take a picture. The picture will be used to calibrate the device, please refer to the previous chapter for the picture requirements.

Never move your device once the picture is taken! Also don't move the ArUco graphics until all phones have finished taking pictures. The ArUco pattern can be removed once all equipment has completed the shooting operation. If devices are accidentally moved, ArUco patterns are rearranged and pictures are re-taken on each device.

The setting of the mobile terminal is completed here. Please keep the APP in the foreground state, and keep the phone with sufficient power.

## Personal Computer Settings

### VMT Setup

Virtual Motion Tracker(VMT) is an easy-to-use virtual tracker driver for OpenVR. You can send pose (position and rotation) with OSC Protocol and use it as a virtual tracker on SteamVR. You can learn more about VMT on [VirtualMotionTrackerDocument](https://gpsnmeajp.github.io/VirtualMotionTrackerDocument/).

MakiFBT Requires VMT to communicate with SteamVR. System will not work without VMT.

We tested our system on vmt_013c. You can download [HERE](https://github.com/gpsnmeajp/VirtualMotionTracker/releases/download/v0.13c/vmt_013c.zip).

Newer version of VMT can be found on [VMT Release Page](https://github.com/gpsnmeajp/VirtualMotionTracker/releases). HOWEVER, performance is not guaranteed.

To install VMT, unzip the archive, open **vmt_manager** folder, run **vmt_manager.exe** with SteamVR running and VR devices connected. Click install and you are ready to go.

### MakiFBT Setup

To use MakiFBT, download our software for windows [Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive).

**Please start SteamVR and the Android side of MakiFBT first, start the computer side of MakiFBT afterward.** Wrong order cause no negative effect, but may requires additional operation.

When MakiFBT starts normally, you can see the extra VMT device in the device interface of SteamVR and in the VR world as well.
