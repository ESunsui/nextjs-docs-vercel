## Recalibrating trackers

If you think the currently used parameters are wrong, or feel that the position of the tracker in SteamVR is obviously incorrect, you can automatically generate new parameters through the ReCalibration button.

Parameter generation uses vector normal operations, so we recommend using the following poses for correction:

Stand straight in the center of the play area, with your hands stretched out straight to the front left and right (between the side raise and the front raise).

The automatic calibration process will last for about 5 seconds. When you see that the value in the parameter column no longer changes, it means that the automatic parameter generation has been completed.

## Revert to auto-generated parameters

If you manually modify the parameters after automatic calibration but are not satisfied with it, or touch the parameter panel by mistake and want to return to the automatic calibration parameters, click "Revert Auto Cfg" to restore the last automatic calibration parameters.
