These keys are for the operation of the entire FBT system.

## Start Detection

Click the button to start full body motion tracking. After pressing the button, the system collects information from each edge device and starts the reconstruction of 3D key points.

## Stop Detection

Click the button to stop full body tracking. After pressing the button, the system will stop the video stream acquisition of each edge device and stop the reconstruction of key points.

## Recalibrate System

Recalibrate the entire FBT system. The system will re-acquire images from each edge device to calibrate the positional relationship.

This should be done after you accidentally move a device. This will remove all known devices, rediscover and pair them, and treat them as new.

For the sake of user privacy, we will not automatically trigger the camera logic on the mobile phone. Users using Android phones, please rearrange the ArUco pattern according to the settings in the "Quick Start" chapter, and take a photo again. After you finish taking pictures of the edge device, click the recalibration button. Only the picture you took will be transferred to the computer and processed strictly locally.

Depending on the situation, the recalibration process may last tens of seconds, please wait patiently.

## Show Calib image

Show the image used for correction. When recalibrating, the button will become non-interactive. When the button lights up again and the displayed pictures are normal, it usually means that the calibration is complete.
